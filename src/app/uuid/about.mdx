### What is NIL UUID 

A nil UUID is a UUID that has all 128 bits set to zero. It's represented as:

`00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`


#### Usage

- Initialization: When you need to initialize a UUID variable but don't have a value yet.
- Placeholder: As a placeholder when a UUID is optional or not applicable.
- Error Handling: To indicate the absence of a value in error scenarios.

### What is UUID V1

UUID v1 generates unique identifiers using the host computer's MAC address and the current timestamp, ensuring that each UUID is unique.

#### Structure

A UUID v1 is displayed as 32 hexadecimal digits, split into five groups, like this:

`bef45a40-d8b1-11ee-ad50-4bc2c7961874`

#### How It Works

- **Timestamp**: The current date and time provide the first part of the UUID, ensuring temporal uniqueness.
- **MAC Address**: The host computer's MAC address is used as a spatially unique identifier.
- **Random Component**: A random element is added to further ensure uniqueness.

### What is UUID V3

UUID v3 creates unique identifiers by hashing a namespace identifier and a name using the MD5 hashing algorithm.

#### Structure

A UUID v3 looks like this:

`6222b113-5f4f-34ad-99cd-2e42c0cc0e72`

#### How It Works

- **Namespace Identifier**: A predefined UUID that represents a certain domain or namespace.
- **Name**: A string within the specified namespace.

The combination of these two is hashed using MD5 to produce a UUID v3.

### What is UUID V4

UUID v4 is a universally unique identifier that is generated using random numbers.

#### Structure

A UUID v4 is displayed as 32 hexadecimal digits, split into five groups, like this:

`e81a5ce9-781c-46ab-993d-adc57c76a8b9`

#### How It Works

- **Randomness**: All the bits in a UUID v4 are generated randomly, providing a high degree of uniqueness.
- **No Inherent Logic**: Unlike other UUID versions, v4 doesn't use time stamps or hardware addresses to generate the ID.

### What is UUID V5

UUID v5 creates unique identifiers by hashing a namespace identifier and a name using the SHA-1 hashing algorithm.

#### Structure

A UUID v5 is displayed as 32 hexadecimal digits, split into five groups, like this:

`74738ff5-5367-5958-9aee-98fffdcd1876`

#### How It Works

- **Namespace Identifier**: A predefined UUID that represents a certain domain or namespace.
- **Name**: A string within the specified namespace.

The combination of these two is hashed using SHA-1 to produce a UUID v5.
